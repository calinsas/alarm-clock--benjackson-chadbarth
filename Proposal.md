For our ECE 287 final project we are going to make an alarm clock that will notify you when you need to wake up and some time before the alarm goes off some lights will slowly turn on.  The current time and alarm time will be displayed on the LCD on the DE2 board.

## First: ##
**Understand how to put information up on the LCD screen on the DE2 board.**

**Figure out how to write a code that counts every second and puts minutes and hours on the screen.**

**Next figure out how to set a certain time and when the clock matches that time make a sound that comes out of the line out output.
Learn how to generate lights that go on the same time the sound is produced.**

**Learn how to make a harmonic sound.**

**Figure out how to set the time on the FPGA board.**

## Features: ##
**Have a nice sounding alarm.**

**Have lights come on when the alarm rings.**

## Work: ##
We will divide the work will be by our strengths and weaknesses that each other has.  If we both have a weakness in something in common we will work together on the problem. This way it will be a more efficient process.
