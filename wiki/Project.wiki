=Description=

For our final project we decided to make an alarm clock with the DE2 board. We are using the HEX to display the current time and the set time to wake up. We wrote 100% of the code for the alarm clock that displays,  to the HEX display.

==Background==

We decided to make an alarm clock after talking about how hard it was to wake up for morning classes. We were also talking about making our own alarm clock with an Arduino as a project on our spare time and if we could make an alarm clock on an FPGA we could definitely make one from an Arduino.

==Details==

With a single DE2 board we were able to accomplish a real world working alarm clock with the seven segment display to show the current time and the time to wake up. The user can toggle between the real time and alarm set time using a switch. The user can also set the clock or alarm by incrementing the hours or the minutes. There is also a button that will reset the alarm, turning off the sound, and allowing the alarm to go off the next time the alarm time is reached.

Some of the challenges we faced with writing the clock was to make the typical AM and PM clock that we use in the United States instead of the 24 hour clock that the rest of the world uses. You can watch the FPGA board in action in this [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2cwhybu53I video].

Some code we had to use from [http://www.johnloomis.org John Loomis's website]. The code we used from him can be found [http://www.johnloomis.org/digitallab/audio/audio3/audio3.html here]. His project took input from the Switches and outputted a signal to the speakers. In his original project the audio was only sent to the right speakers. We changed the value of the sound frequency and then switched between each frequency every half second to produce out alarm sound.


===Controls===
SW0 - Switches the current time and alarm set time.

Key3 - Changes the hours.

Key2 - Changes the minutes.

Key1 - Dismisses the alarm.

Key0 - Resets the Current time and Alarm time.
